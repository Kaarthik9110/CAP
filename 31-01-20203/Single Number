Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        c=1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
           if(nums.count(nums[i])==1):
               return nums[i]
               break
          
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
